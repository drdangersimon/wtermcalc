wtermcalc
=========

Python code to visualize the phase variation of the non-coplanar baselines term in radio interferometry.

This code computes the phase variation of the non-coplanar baselines term (or the w-term) for w-values of w, w/2 and 0
and plots all three along with their corresponding Fourier transforms.
